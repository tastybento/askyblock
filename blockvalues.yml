# This file lists the values for various blocks that are used to calculate the
# island level. Level = total of all blocks in island boundary / 100.
# Underwater block multiplier
# If blocks are below sea-level, they can have a higher value. e.g. 2x
# Promotes under-water development if there is a sea. Value can be fractional.
underwater: 1.0

# Value of one island level. Default 100. Minimum value is 1.
levelcost: 100

# Death penalty
# How many block values a player will lose per death.
# Default value of 100 means that for every death, the player will lose 1 level (if levelcost is 100)
# Set to zero to not use this feature
deathpenalty: 100
# Sum team deaths - if true, all the teams deaths are summed
# If false, only the leader's deaths counts
sumteamdeaths: false
# Max deaths
# If player dies more than this, it doesn't count anymore
# Stops players from getting into an impossible situation
maxdeaths: 10

# This section lists the limits for any particular block. Blocks over this amount
# are not counted.
# Format:
# MATERIAL: limit or MATERIAL:DATA: limit.
# If DATA is used, there MUST be a corresponding block:data value in the blocks list.
# For example, if you limit Jungle Logs LOG:3, then there must be a value for LOG:3
# in the blocks section. If there is not, then LOG:3 would have no value.

# This section lists the value of a block. Value must be an integer.
# Any blocks not listed will have a value of zero.
