# Challenges
# Rewards and required items have to be described using Bukkit Materials
# and be exactly correct
# Do not use Type Id's - they will not work
# Challenges can be one of three types - player, island or level.
# player - means the player must have the items on them
# island - means the items have to be on the island and within 10 blocks of the player
#          entities are also supported, e.g., COW.
# level - means the island level has to be equal or over this amount.
#         If level is set as nothing '', then the challenge is a free challenge and can be
#         done at any time.
# Challenges can be repeatable only if they are player challenges
# permissions can be given as a reward
#
# Reward Commands - commands can be run when a challenge is completed and repeated
# Commands are:
#    rewardcommands:
#      - command1
#      - command2
#    repeatrewardcommands:
#      - command1
#      - command2      
# The commands are listed and run in order. Do not put a / in front of the command.
# The token [player] will be replaced with the player's name.
# Example:
#    rewardcommands:
#      - pex promote [player]
#      - heal [player]
#      - warp winner_circle [player]
# If a command fails, it will be noted in the console.
#
# The format for POTIONS is as follows:
#
# Format POTION:NAME:<LEVEL>:<EXTENDED>:<SPLASH/LINGER>:QTY
# LEVEL, EXTENDED, SPLASH, LINGER are optional.

# POTION:STRENGTH:1:EXTENDED:SPLASH:1
# POTION:INSTANT_DAMAGE:2::LINGER:2
# POTION:JUMP:2:NOTEXTENDED:NOSPLASH:1
# POTION:WEAKNESS::::1   -  any weakness potion

# WATER, REGEN, SPEED, FIRE_RESISTANCE, POISON, INSTANT_HEAL, NIGHT_VISION, WEAKNESS,
# STRENGTH, SLOWNESS, JUMP, INSTANT_DAMAGE, WATER_BREATHING, INVISIBILITY
# For V1.9 these are also available:
# LUCK, MUNDANE, THICK, AWKWARD
#
# The format for TIPPED_ARROWs is as follows:
# Format TIPPED_ARROW:NAME:<LEVEL>:<EXTENDED>:QUANTITY
#
# LEVEL and EXTENDED are optional.
# LEVEL is a number, 1 or 2
# Examples:

# their island (see resetchallenges in config.yml). You can stop some challenges from
# being reset by using resetAllowed:false in the challenge.
