# Config for ASkyblock
# It is recommended that you check at least these settings:
#
# 1. island distance - the distance between islands. If upgrading set to what you had.
# 2. resetmoney (general section) - set to true so that everyone starts with nothing
# 3. islandLevel (general section) - the height you want your islands to float
# 4. protectionRange - how big a player's island is at the start

island:

   # 400 - puts players distance enough that they usually cannot see each other
   # 200 - allows some expansion of the protected zone (recommended)
   # 110 - for compatibility with established worlds. Cozy.
   # 50 - minimum - not recommended

   # Value must be an even number
