# Config for A SkyBlock (also playable as AcidIsland)
# For initial set up you must configure or check at least these settings:
#
# 1. distance (in the island section) - the distance between islands
# 2. resetmoney - set to true so that everyone starts with nothing
# 3. islandLevel - the height you want your islands to float
# 4. protectionRange - big a player's island is at the start
#
# The plugin will NOT start until #1 is set!!!

island:
   # Space between islands in blocks - NEVER change this mid-game.
   # Values for a new world:
   # 400 - puts players distance enough that they usually cannot see each other
   # 200 - allows some expansion of the protected zone (recommended)
   # 110 - for compatibility with established worlds. Cozy.
   # 50 - minimum - not recommended
   # IF YOU ARE UPGRADING YOU MUST USE YOUR OLD VALUE EXACTLY, E.G., 110
   # OR RESET YOUR WORLD
   # You MUST set this value to start the plugin!

   distance: -1

   # The size of the protective region for new islands.
   # Large sizes will slow down island level calculation
   # when players do /is level.
   # Value MUST be an even number.
   # Recommended size is 100 because it gives players a good starting size.
   # Minimum size is 50.
   # Admins can change protection sizes for players individually using
   # Value must be at least 16 blocks less than the island distance unless you set
   # overridelimit: true below.
