# Config for ASkyBlock V${version}
# Maintainer: tastybento
# It is recommended that you check at least these settings:
#
# 1. island distance - the distance between islands. If upgrading set to what you had.
#    If you change island distance, you MUST reset the world.
# 2. resetmoney (general section) - set to true so that everyone starts with nothing
# 3. islandLevel (general section) - the height you want your islands to float
# 4. protectionRange - how big a player's island is at the start
#

##### Island Related Settings #####

island:
   # Space between islands in blocks - NEVER change this mid-game.
   # Values for a new world:
   # 400 - puts players distance enough that they usually cannot see each other
   # 200 - allows some expansion of the protected zone (recommended)
   # 110 - for compatibility with established worlds. Cozy.
   # 50 - minimum - not recommended
   # IF YOU ARE UPGRADING YOU MUST USE YOUR OLD VALUE EXACTLY, E.G., 110
   # OR RESET YOUR WORLD
   # Value must be an even number
   distance: 200

   # Default protection range (even number). Min = 0, Recommended = 100
   # Larger values will take longer to calculate the island level
   # Admins can change protection sizes for players individually using /asadmin setrange
   # or set this permission: askyblock.island.range.<number>
   # For optimal performance, keep protection range at leat 16 blocks less than distance.
   protectionRange: 100

   # Start islands at these coordinates. This is where new islands will start in the
   # world. These must be a factor of your island distance, but the plugin will auto
   # calculate the closest location on the grid. Islands develop around this location
   # both positively and negatively in a square grid.
   # If none of this makes sense, leave it at 0,0.

   # Sea level height (don't changes this mid-game unless you delete the world)
   # Minimum is 0, which means you are playing sky block!

   # if it exists. Makes for an interesting variation on skyblock.

   # Island level - the height of the island.
   # Lowest level is 5
   islandlevel: 120

   #How many resets a player is allowed (override with /asadmin clearreset <player>
   #Value of -1 means unlimited, 0 means hardcore - no resets.

   #The number of seconds to wait for confirmation of a reset

   # Use <Data> to set the durability of a item or to select sub-items/colors.
   # 
   # Spawn Eggs must be defined by name, e.g., MONSTER_EGG:PIG
   #
   # The format for POTIONS is as follows:
   #
   # Format POTION:NAME:<LEVEL>:<EXTENDED>:<SPLASH/LINGER>:QTY
   # LEVEL, EXTENDED, SPLASH, LINGER are optional.
   # LEVEL is a number, 1 or 2
   # LINGER is for V1.9 servers and later
   # Examples:
   # POTION:STRENGTH:1:EXTENDED:SPLASH:1
   # POTION:INSTANT_DAMAGE:2::LINGER:2
   # POTION:JUMP:2:::1
   # POTION:WEAKNESS::::1   -  any weakness potion
