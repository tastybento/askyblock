# Config for ASkyBlock V${version}
# Maintainer: tastybento
# It is recommended that you check at least these settings:
#
# 1. island distance - the distance between islands. If upgrading set to what you had.
#    If you change island distance, you MUST reset the world.
# 2. resetmoney (general section) - set to true so that everyone starts with nothing
# 3. islandLevel (general section) - the height you want your islands to float
# 4. protectionRange - how big a player's island is at the start

island:
   # Space between islands in blocks - NEVER change this mid-game.
   # Values for a new world:
   # 400 - puts players distance enough that they usually cannot see each other
   # 200 - allows some expansion of the protected zone (recommended)
   # 110 - for compatibility with established worlds. Cozy.
   # 50 - minimum - not recommended
   # IF YOU ARE UPGRADING YOU MUST USE YOUR OLD VALUE EXACTLY, E.G., 110
   # OR RESET YOUR WORLD
   # Value must be an even number
   distance: 200

   # Default protection range (even number). Min = 0, Recommended = 100
   # Larger values will take longer to calculate the island level
   # Admins can change protection sizes for players individually using /asadmin setrange
   # or set this permission: askyblock.island.range.<number>
   # For optimal performance, keep protection range at leat 16 blocks less than distance.
   protectionRange: 100

   # Start islands at these coordinates. This is where new islands will start in the
   # world. These must be a factor of your island distance, but the plugin will auto
   # calculate the closest location on the grid. Islands develop around this location
   # both positively and negatively in a square grid.
